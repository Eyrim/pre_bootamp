    The term "instance variable" is another name for _non-static field_.
    The term "class variable" is another name for _static field_.
    A local variable stores temporary state; it is declared inside a _method_.
    A variable declared within the opening and closing parenthesis of a method signature is called a _parameter_.
    What are the eight primitive data types supported by the Java programming language? _byte, char, short, int, long, double, float, bool_
    Character strings are represented by the class _String_.
    An _array_ is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.


    Consider the following code snippet.

    arrayOfInts[j] > arrayOfInts[j+1]

    Which operators does the code contain? _>, +_
    Consider the following code snippet.

    int i = 10;
    int n = i++%5;

        What are the values of i and n after the code is executed? _i: 11, n: 0_
        What are the final values of i and n if instead of using the postfix increment operator (i++), you use the prefix version (++i))? _i: 11, n: 1_
    To invert the value of a boolean, which operator would you use? _!_
    Which operator is used to compare two values, = or == ? _==_
    Explain the following code sample: result = someCondition ? value1 : value2; _elvis operator, if someCondition is true, then value1 will be assigned to result, else value2 will be assigned to result_

Change the following program to use compound assignments:

_
class ArithmeticDemo {

     public static void main (String[] args){
          
          int result = 1 + 2; // result is now 3
          System.out.println(result);

          result -= 1; // result is now 2
          System.out.println(result);

          result =* 2; // result is now 4
          System.out.println(result);

          result =/ 2; // result is now 2
          System.out.println(result);

          result =+ 8; // result is now 10
          result =% 7; // result is now 3
          System.out.println(result);
     }
}
_

In the following program, explain why the value "6" is printed twice in a row:

_
class PrePostDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int i = 3;
        i++;
        System.out.println(i);    // "4"
        ++i;                     
        System.out.println(i);    // "5"
        System.out.println(++i);  // "6"
        System.out.println(i++);  // "6"
        System.out.println(i);    // "7"
    }
}

Because the post-crement operator will only increment after the operation on the right hand has been carried out in a complex expression. In other words it will give the value of i, then increment it, thus printing 6 twice.

    The most basic control flow statement supported by the Java programming language is the _if_ statement.
    The _switch_ statement allows for any number of possible execution paths.
    The _do while_ statement is similar to the while statement, but evaluates its expression at the _end_ of the loop.
    How do you write an infinite loop using the for statement? _for (; ;)_
    How do you write an infinite loop using the while statement? _while (true)_



    Consider the following code snippet.

    if (aNumber >= 0)
        if (aNumber == 0)
            System.out.println("first string");
    else System.out.println("second string");
    System.out.println("third string");

        What output do you think the code will produce if aNumber is 3? _"third string"_
        Write a test program containing the previous code snippet; make aNumber 3. What is the output of the program? _"second string" "third string"_ 
        Is it what you predicted? _No_
        Explain why the output is what it is; in other words, what is the control flow for the code snippet? _Because when the brackets are ommitted the else clause attaches to the most recent if, despite nesting_
        Using only spaces and line breaks, reformat the code snippet to make the control flow easier to understand.
        _
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            int aNumber = 3;

            if (aNumber >= 0)
              if (aNumber == 0)
                System.out.println("first string");
                
              else 
                System.out.println("second string");
            
            System.out.println("third string");
        }
        _

        Use braces, { and }, to further clarify the code.
        _
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            int aNumber = 3;

            if (aNumber >= 0) {
              if (aNumber == 0) {
                System.out.println("first string");
              } else {
                System.out.println("second string");
              }
            } 
            
            System.out.println("third string");
        }

    Use the API documentation to find the answers to the following questions:

        What Integer method can you use to convert an int into a string that expresses the number in hexadecimal? For example, what method converts the integer 65 into the string "41"? java.lang.Integer::toHexString

        What Integer method would you use to convert a string expressed in base 5 into the equivalent int? For example, how would you convert the string "230" into the integer value 65? Show the code you would use to accomplish this task.

        _
        public static void main(String[] args) {
          String val = "230"; // base 5

          System.out.println(Integer.parseInt(val, 5));
        }
        _

        What Double method can you use to detect whether a floating-point number has the special value Not a Number (NaN)?
        _Double.isNaN()_

    What is the value of the following expression, and why?

    Integer.valueOf(1).equals(Long.valueOf(1))

    _false, Integer and Long cannot be implicitly cast into each other, therefore the int value of 1 and the long value of 1 are different (probably due to being represented as different binary values due to the increased number of bits)_




    Change MaxVariablesDemo to show minimum values instead of maximum values. You can delete all code related to the variables aChar and aBoolean. What is the output?

    _
    The largest byte value is -128.
    The largest short value is -32768.
    The largest integer value is -2147483648.
    The largest long value is -9223372036854775808.
    The largest float value is 1.4E-45.
    The largest double value is 4.9E-324.

    Create a program that reads an unspecified number of integer arguments from the command line and adds them together. For example, suppose that you enter the following:

    java Adder 1 3 2 10

    The program should display 16 and then exit. The program should display an error message if the user enters only one argument. You can base your program on ValueOfDemo.

_
            if (args.length <= 2) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Needs more args");
          }
      
          System.out.println(
            Arrays.stream(args)
                .reduce((total, i) -> total + i)
                .getAsInt()
          );
_

    Create a program that is similar to the previous one but has the following differences:
        Instead of reading integer arguments, it reads floating-point arguments.
        It displays the sum of the arguments, using exactly two digits to the right of the decimal point.

    For example, suppose that you enter the following:

    java FPAdder 1 1e2 3.0 4.754

    The program would display 108.75. Depending on your locale, the decimal point might be a comma (,) instead of a period (.).

_
        if (args.length <= 2) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Needs more args");
        }

      
          System.out.println(
            String.format(
                "%.2f",

                Arrays.stream(args)
                    .reduce((total, i) -> total + i)
                    .get()
            )
        );

    Consider the following class:

    public class IdentifyMyParts {
        public static int x = 7; 
        public int y = 3; 
    }

        What are the class variables? _x_

        What are the instance variables? _y_

        What is the output from the following code:

        IdentifyMyParts a = new IdentifyMyParts();
        IdentifyMyParts b = new IdentifyMyParts();
        a.y = 5;
        b.y = 6;
        a.x = 1;
        b.x = 2;
        System.out.println("a.y = " + a.y); _5_
        System.out.println("b.y = " + b.y); _6_
        System.out.println("a.x = " + a.x); _2_
        System.out.println("b.x = " + b.x); _2_
        System.out.println("IdentifyMyParts.x = " + IdentifyMyParts.x); _2_



What is wrong with the following program? _myRect is never initialised_

The following code creates one array and one string object. How many references to those objects exist after the code executes? Is either object eligible for garbage collection? _2 references neither is eligble because studentName is being used by the array, the value of the array isn't null, it still exists and therefore is not eligible__

How does a program destroy and object that it creates? _It calls the destructor if there is one, else it just removes all of it's references_

_
pubic class SomethingIsWrong {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Rectangle myRect = new Rectangle();
		myRect.width = 40;
		myRect.height = 50;
		System.out.println("myRect's area is " + myRect.area());
	}
}

Given the following class NumberHolder, write some code that creates an instance of the class, initialises its two member variables and then displays the value of each member variable

_
public class NumberHolder {
	public int anInt;
	public float aFloat;
}

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {	
		NumberHolder nh = new NumberHolder();
		nh.anInt = 5;
		nh.aFloat = 4.0f;
		
		System.out.println(nh.anInt);
		System.out.println(nh.aFloat);
	}
}

The program Problem.java doesn't compile. What do you need to do to make it compile? Why?

_
	
Make the inner class a nested class. Because inner classes are static and cannot access instance members of their enclosing class. It never gets a reference
_


Use the Java API documentation for the Box class (in the javax.swing package_ to help you answer the following questions:

what static nested class does Box define: _Box.Filler_

what inner class does Box define: _AccessibleBox_

what is the superclass of Box's inner class: _JComponent_

Which of Box's nested classes can you use from any class: _AccessibleBox_

How do you create an instance of Box's Filler class: _Box.Filler filler = new Box.Filler_
